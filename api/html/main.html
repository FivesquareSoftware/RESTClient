<h1>RESTClient Documentation</h1><p><a class="el" href="interface_r_c_resource.html">RCResource</a> is the primary public interface for RESTKit, and each instance is meant to reflect an actual resource residing on the WWW, generally accessed via a REST web service. Configuration</p>
<p>Child resources can be constructed from parents, and will inherit all the configuration information of their ancestors. Their URLs are constructed as sub-URLs to their parents, and they retain their parents, to allow dynamic lookup of an ancestor's configuration information. With the exception of headers, configuration is an either/or prospectâ€”it comes from only one resource in the chain, whether that is the receiver or one of the ancestors. Headers, being a mutable dictionary are merged down the whole tree.</p>
<p>Lifecycle</p>
<p>A resource has a lifecycle that is defined by the blocks you can run at various points in the execution of a request for the resource. These points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>preflight, which can abort a request</li>
<li>progress, which can be either up or down depending on the type of request</li>
<li>postprocess, which can perform transformations and other work based on the results of the request</li>
<li>completion, which runs when a request completes, regardless of success or failure The posprocess block is unique because it runs on the high-priority concurrent global queue, whereas all the other blocks run on the main queue to allow UI code to safely run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Authentication</p>
<p>Each resource can have an instance of an authentication provider, which implements &lt;RCAuthProvider&gt; and can do any kind of authentication that is supported by the protocol. A BASIC auth provider is included with <a class="el" href="interface_r_e_s_t_client.html" title="RESTClient is the main header for the RESTClient HTTP client and provides some static...">RESTClient</a>, and if username and password are set on a resource, an instance of this provider will be created on demand.</p>
<p>Encoding/Decoding</p>
<p>Payloads and results are serialized/deserialized automatically using instances of &lt;RCCoder&gt;. </p>
